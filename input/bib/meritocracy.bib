  abstract = {Different beliefs about the fairness of social competition and what determines
income inequality influence the redistributive policy chosen in a society. But the
composition of income in equilibrium depends on tax policies. We show how the
interaction between social beliefs and welfare policies may lead to multiple equilibria
or multiple steady states. If a society believes that individual effort determines
income, and that all have a right to enjoy the fruits of their effort, it will choose low
redistribution and low taxes. In equilibrium, effort will be high and the role of luck
will be limited, in which case market outcomes will be relatively fair and social
beliefs will be self-fulfilled. If instead, a society believes that luck, birth, connections,
and/or corruption determine wealth, it will levy high taxes, thus distorting
allocations and making these beliefs self-sustained as well. These insights may help
explain the cross-country variation in perceptions about income inequality and
choices of redistributivep olicies. (JEL D31, E62, H2, P16)},

This article argues that this thesis may not be appropriate to understand societies with different cultural traditions and institutional practices. Based upon the results of qualitative research conducted in Chile the article discusses the existence of a specific path to individuation in this society. The data show the analytical preeminence within the individuation process in Chile of a group of competences that must be generated and developed in confronting social life itself. Individuation leads in Chile to the constitution of relational hyper-actors based upon four dimensions: self-effort, abilities, interpersonal relationships and pragmatic consistency. This is what we propose to understand as agentic individualism.},

Anrechte etc.) vornehmlich \"uber den Arbeitsmarkt und die berufsm\"a\ss ige Erwerbst\"atigkeit im Lebenslauf (M\"uller und Mayer 1986).
Der Erwerb von Bildung und Qualifikationen ist eine essentielle Voraussetzung f\"ur den Zugang zum Arbeitsmarkt (Blossfeld 1989;
Becker 1993; Hillmert und Mayer 2004; Solga 2005). F\"ur die Systemintegration, d.h. das reibungslose Funktionieren der gesellschaftlichen
Teilsysteme, sowie f\"ur die Sozialintegration, d.h. die Teilhabe an gesellschaftlichen Teilbereichen, spielt daher der Zugang
zu Bildung und Erwerb von Bildungszertifikaten ebenso eine bedeutsame Rolle wie der Zugang zum Arbeitsmarkt und der Erwerb
von Einkommen (Lockwood 1964; Mayer 1994, 2000). Die Verteilung der G\"uter und Positionen im Bildungs- und Besch\"aftigungssystem
erfolgt \textendash{} so die vorherrschende gesellschaftliche Vorstellung \textendash{} im Sinne von Chancengleichheit nach dem Leistungsprinzip,
mit dem das Ausma\ss{} und die Struktur der sozialen Ungleichheit von Bildung, Status und Einkommen legitimiert werden (Hadjar
2008; Mayer 1975). Zugang zu Bildung oder Beruf und Erwerb von Bildung und Einkommen sollen demnach ausschlie\ss lich \"uber meritokratische
Prinzipien als legitimer Mechanismus f\"ur die Verteilung von G\"utern und des gesellschaftlichen Status erfolgen. Die an Bildung
gekn\"upfte und gesellschaftlich anerkannte Verteilung von Status, Einkommen, Macht und anderen Privilegien wird demzufolge
aufgrund individueller Leistung als Indikator von im Wettbewerb erworbenen Verdiensten (,,contest mobility``) und nicht aufgrund
von vererbtem Status etwa nach adliger Herkunft (,,sponsored mobility``) oder nach anderen askriptiven Merkmalen wie Geschlecht
oder Rasse vorgenommen (vgl. Turner 1960). Eine Gesellschaft, die \"Amter, Ansehen und Reichtum ausschlie\ss lich nach Leistung
vergibt, erscheint fairer als eine auf althergebrachten Privilegien beruhende Feudalgesellschaft oder als ein Wohlfahrtsstaat,
der bestrebt ist, durch gezielte Eingriffe in die Lebensumst\"ande von Menschen individuelle und kollektive Chancengleichheit
herzustellen. In einer meritokratischen Gesellschaft hingegen wird die soziale Schichtung nach sozialer Herkunft scheinbar
durch eine soziale Schichtung nach individueller Leistung ersetzt. Das Leistungsprinzip auf der Basis einer Chancengleichheit
im Bildungserwerb ist ihr entscheidendes Grundprinzip (Young 1958). Wenn sich aber in dieser Logik individuelle Leistung nicht
mehr lohnt und soziale Ungleichheit nicht mehr mit rationalen Kriterien wie Talent, Anstrengung und Leistung legitimiert werden
kann, scheinen die System- und Sozialintegration und damit auch der Zusammenhalt von Gesellschaften nicht mehr gew\"ahrleistet.},

Results from college students in the United States and Germany revealed the following. First, reactions to allocators form two clusters: intelligent/strong/logical and warm/nice. Second, when giving a positive resource, American allocators are in a real dilemma: If they give on the basis of merit, they are rated high on the first cluster but low on the second; if they favor the needy, reactions reverse. No such dilemma exists for German allocators or in negative allocation situations where everyone approves of a need allocation. Third, Americans evaluate equality allocators quite highly, especially in the negative allocation condition. Fourth, allocators who have bonuses to distribute are evaluated more positively-another example of the fundamental attribution error.},

Several characteristic features of the American educational system are identified: the avoidance of early selection, the lack of sharp segmentation between different types of institutions, relative freedom of movement both among and within institutions, openness to new fields of study, high levels of enrollment, and the provision of opportunities for educational mobility well into adulthood. The two-year public community college, it argues, is an essential expression of these patterns which, through its very accessibility, reinforces the American ideology that it is never too late for individual talent to reveal itself - and to be rewarded. The article concludes with a discussion of the effects of the nation's distinctive school system on American culture and politics, suggesting that the perceived ldquoclasslessnessrdquo of American society may in part be a product of its seemingly open and democratic structure of education.

Despite the constant references to meritocracy in inequality and stratification research, there are still few conceptual and empirical attempts to understand to what extent individuals perceive and prefer meritocracy, as well as their consequences. The present research proposes a conceptual and empirical framework for  studying meritocratic perceptions and preferences, which is then related with economic inequality variables. Using data from the Chilean survey ``Social justice and citizenship participation'', the analyses suggest that meritocratic perceptions and preferences are different constructs and that those perceiving an adequate functioning of meritocracy also perceive less economic inequality.},

At the individual level, education strengthens support for education-based meritocracy but has less impact on perceptions of meritocracy. National indicators are also associated with perceived and preferred meritocracy. Perceived meritocracy is correlated with the expansion of the education system, while the support for education-based meritocracy is correlated with average returns to education. We also find that perceptions and preferences may be affected by such national characteristics as inequality and the average wealth.},

We test these arguments using an online experiment that manipulated the level of inequality (high vs. low) in an anonymized society. Participants perceived a larger merit gap in high versus low inequality societies. Our arguments and findings have implications for attitudes about inequality and redistributive policies.},

Previous research suggests that children have an early ability to take merit into account in third-party situations but that merit-based sharing in first-party contexts does not emerge until school-age. Here we provide evidence that three- and five-year-old children already use merit to share resources with others, even when sharing is costly for the child. In Study 1, a child and a puppet-partner collected coins that were later exchanged for rewards. We varied the work-contribution of both partners by manipulating how many coins each partner collected. Children kept fewer stickers in trials in which they had contributed less than in trials in which they had contributed more than the partner, showing that they took merit into account. Few children, however, gave away more than half of the stickers when the partner had worked more.

Using data from the European Social Survey rounds 1 to 8, for each country-round, the author identifies the theoretical meritocratic joint distribution of education and occupational status, as well as the theoretical distribution under statistical independence, and measures the distance of empirical distributions to these two ideal situations. The author finds that the distance to meritocracy varies substantially across European countries, with some countries being closer to allocation under independence than to meritocratic allocation. In terms of cross-country differences, the distance to meritocracy is smaller in postcommunist countries than in Western Europe, with some convergence observable over time.},

A simple model of meritocratic allocation is proposed and applied to provide empirical assessment of "how far to meritocracy?" from empirical reality. The model, conceptualized as an ideal type of meritocracy, incorporates the principle according to which more educated persons do not have lower status than less educated ones. Assuming that a meritocratic society should resemble its ideal type, we have formulated three testable hypotheses involving status mobility within educational groups, status determination by education, and status inequality among educational groups. The tests consist of evaluating the discrepancies between the data on the U.S. total labor force and the model.

Using the International Social Survey Project (ISSP): Social Inequality Module (1992), we examine both individual-level and country-level determinants of pro-meritocratic attitudes. According to self-interest and rational-action theories, individuals with high educational attainment and high personal income are expected to have strong meritocratic beliefs because meritocracy is in their best interest\textemdash they would gain under such a system. At the same time, both modernization and post-industrial theories imply that persons living in countries with a high degree of societal meritocracy hold stronger meritocratic beliefs than persons living in countries with low degree of societal meritocracy. Results of the Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analysis on a data set including 7,972 persons from 14 countries indicate that the impact of individuals' education and income on meritocratic attitudes occurred as theoretically predicted. We also demonstrate that the relationship between the degree of societal meritocracy and the degree of support for such a system is statistically significant even if national wealth and educational stock (as well as individual-level variables) are controlled. In addition, we discovered that at the beginning of the 1990s a post-communist regime had a negative effect on support for meritocracy.},

  abstract = {Economic inequality has been on the rise in the United States since the 1980s and by some measures stands at levels not seen since before the Great Depression. Although the strikingly high and rising level of economic inequality in the nation has alarmed scholars, pundits, and elected officials alike, research across the social sciences repeatedly concludes that Americans are largely unconcerned about it. Considerable research has documented, for instance, the important role of psychological processes, such as system justification and American Dream ideology, in engendering Americans' relative insensitivity to economic inequality. The present work offers, and reports experimental tests of, a different perspective\textemdash the opportunity model of beliefs about economic inequality. Specifically, two convenience samples (study 1, n = 480; and study 2, n = 1,305) and one representative sample (study 3, n = 1,501) of American adults were exposed to information about rising economic inequality in the United States (or control information) and then asked about their beliefs regarding the roles of structural (e.g., being born wealthy) and individual (e.g., hard work) factors in getting ahead in society (i.e., opportunity beliefs). They then responded to policy questions regarding the roles of business and government actors in reducing economic inequality. Rather than revealing insensitivity to rising inequality, the results suggest that rising economic inequality in contemporary society can spark skepticism about the existence of economic opportunity in society that, in turn, may motivate support for policies designed to redress economic inequality.},

  abstract = {This paper draws on a literature in sociology, psychology and economics that has extensively documented the unfulfilled promise of meritocracy in education. I argue that the lesson learned from this literature is threefold: (1) educational institutions in practice significantly distort the ideal meritocratic process; (2) opportunities for merit are themselves determined by non-meritocratic factors; (3) any definition of merit must favor some groups in society while putting others at a disadvantage. Taken together, these conclusions give reason to understand meritocracy not just as an unfulfilled promise, but as an unfulfillable promise. Having problematized meritocracy as an ideal worth striving for, I argue that the pervasiveness of meritocratic policies in education threatens to crowd out as principles of justice, need and equality. As such, it may pose a barrier rather than a route to equality of opportunity. Furthermore, meritocratic discourse legitimates societal inequalities as justly deserved such as when misfortune is understood as personal failure. The paper concludes by setting a research agenda that asks how citizens come to hold meritocratic beliefs; addresses the persistence of (unintended) meritocratic imperfections in schools; analyzes the construction of a legitimizing discourse in educational policy; and investigates how education selects and labels winners and losers.},

Studying trends in attitudes is limited by the paucity of survey data that can be compared across countries and over time. Here, I show how to complement survey waves with cohort-level data. Repeated surveys draw on a representative sample of the population to describe the typical beliefs held by citizens in a given country and period. Leveraging the fact that citizens surveyed in a given year were born in different time-periods allows for a comparison of beliefs across birth cohorts. The latter overlaps with the former, but considerably extends the time period covered by the data. Taken together, the two measures give a ``triangulated'' longitudinal record of popular belief in meritocracy. I find that in most countries, popular belief in meritocracy is (much) stronger for more recent periods and cohorts.},

We advance conditional effects hypotheses that collectively argue that the effect of residing in a high-inequality context will be moderated by individual income. Utilizing national survey data, we demonstrate that residing in more unequal counties heightens rejection of meritocracy among low-income residents and bolsters adherence among high-income residents. In relatively equal counties, we find no significant differences between high- and low-income citizens. We conclude by discussing the implications of class-based polarization found in response to local inequality with respect to current debates over the consequences of income inequality for American democracy.},

Few studies, however, have examined whether people believe they live in a meritocratic society. In this paper, we use the 1987 and 2010 General Social Survey to examine people's perceptions of meritocracy in the U.S. Although most Americans agree that getting ahead depends on meritocratic elements like hard work, their beliefs vary in strength. They disagree even more about the importance of non-meritocratic elements such as family wealth, and race. Furthermore, Americans layer these beliefs on top of each other to create a variety of perspectives on meritocracy. Young, upper class Whites are most likely to see the U.S. as a place where meritocratic elements rule. Older, lower class minorities, in contrast, are most likely to believe that non-meritocratic elements dominate. There are also Americans who believe strongly in both types of elements and those who do not believe strongly in either.},

Besides this, attitudes towards income inequality are influenced by inequality-legitimising myths in a given society. Little is known about how these two factors interact. This study combines these two lines of research and argues that different social strata are more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies with strong prevalent meritocratic perceptions. We expect lower-status individuals (i.e. with a lower income or education) to experience a threat to their group esteem and therefore be less likely to support their society's inequalities in societies with such strong meritocratic perceptions. This hypothesis was tested using data from the International Social Survey Programme 2009 (Social Inequality) on 39 countries. The results show that different social strata are indeed more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies where meritocratic perceptions are more prevalent. Our results are robust for income, but not for education. This suggests that in perceived meritocracies, people regard income as the primary indicator of effort and ability.},

Comparisons over time show that actual income inequality predicts later tolerance for income inequality, within 3\textendash 4 years, but earlier tolerance for income inequality does not predict later actual income inequality. These analyses therefore indicate that people adapt how much income inequality they tolerate to actual inequality. They contribute to a long-standing theoretical and empirical discussion about whether material structures influence or result from social norms.},

  abstract = {We present a theoretically informed experimental study of distributive justice norms concerning income distribution. Our study consists of three related experiments that examine how individuals use four distinct allocation principles derived from both normative and empirical research-equality, merit, need, and efficiency-under a condition of impartiality. Our experiments are designed to investigate these principles and to determine how independent factors influence how individuals use them. We find that individuals tend to use all or most of these principles simultaneously in making distributive justice judgments, but that they weigh them differently according to various factors. In particular, we find an expectedly strong difference between how women and men use and weigh these principles. This gender difference parallels-and may even underlie- the gender gap observed in political and policy preferences. CR - Copyright \textcopyright{} 2001 Midwest Political Science Association},

  abstract = {Two decades ago, scholars predicted that the economic and political transformations underway in the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe would be accompanied by fundamental shifts in societal values and norms. Unlike political reforms, changes in societal norms were believed to take place gradually, as individuals became increasingly socialized by new institutions and conditions. In this article, we analyze change in a core set of societal norms\textemdash beliefs in distributive justice\textemdash in the Czech Republic over the last two decades, and locate those trends in regional perspective. What we find is that, over time, the negative association between egalitarian and meritocratic norms has increasingly strengthened, suggesting a crystallization of those norms as opposing value sets. In addition, attachments to those norms are increasingly structured by respondents' socio-economic status. In order words, the research confirms that subjective norms in the Czech Republic are increasingly shaped by objective social status in ways common in advanced democracies, and that we can speak not only of a crystallization of the value system, but of a corresponding ``re-stratification'' of justice beliefs in relation to social position.},

Moreover, we hypothesized that prescriptive beliefs about merit should have a stronger influence on reactions to the status quo when hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies are weak (vs. strong). In 4 studies, participants' preference for the merit principle and hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies were assessed; later, the participants evaluated organizational selection practices that support or challenge the status quo. Participants' prescriptive and descriptive beliefs about merit were separate constructs; only the latter predicted other hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies. In addition, as hypothesized, among participants who weakly endorsed hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies, the stronger their preference for the merit principle, the more they opposed selection practices that were perceived to be merit violating but the more they supported practices that were perceived to be merit restoring. In contrast, those who strongly endorsed hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies were always motivated to support the status quo, regardless of their preference for the merit principle.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses the relationship between education, meritocracy and redistribution. It first questions the meritocratic ideal highlighting how it relates to normative expectations that do not hold fully neither in their logic nor in practice. It then complements the literature on persistent inequalities by focusing on the opportunities for change created by current trends in the economy and in social aspirations. As the meritocratic argument that education is strongly linked to certain rewards in the labour market comes under pressure, increasing social dissatisfaction with education and skills wastage could be expected, as already noted in part of the political economy literature. This literature, however, has tended to conclude from such observations that educational expansion cannot deliver equality. The paper contributes to the debate by focusing on the opportunities created by current trends for the reorganisation of the relationship between education, the economy and society.},

  abstract = {Corruption has a wide range of corrosive effects on societies, but it is widespread throughout the world. There is a question, however, as to whether corruption is endorsed as an outcome of a legitimate hierarchy and meritocracy. To address this issue, the present study examines the associations between meritocratic ideology and the indicators of corruption by performing two empirical studies with correlational and experimental designs. In Study 1, all variables were measured with scales, and the results demonstrated that meritocratic ideologies were negatively associated with corruption perception but positively associated with corrupt intention. In Study 2, meritocratic ideology was manipulated, and the results demonstrated that compared with the low meritocratic-ideology condition, the participants primed by the high meritocratic-ideology condition reported a lower corruption perception but higher corrupt intention. In both studies, the findings suggest that the meritocratic ideology that motivates people to maintain and bolster the current hierarchical structure and meritocracy leads to the endorsement of corruption. The present study explores the roles of meritocratic ideology in the perception and intention of corruption, extends the scope of the predictive power of system justification theory to corruption beyond mere injustice-related aspects of disadvantage, and also provides suggestions for interpreting and fighting against corruption.},

This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the ``meritocratic power'' of a college degree. Drawing on five longitudinal data sets, the author analyzes intergenerational mobility in terms of class, occupational status, earnings, and household income for men and women. Findings indicate that the intergenerational association is strong among those with low educational attainment; it weakens or disappears among bachelor's degree holders but reemerges among those with advanced degrees, leading to a U-shaped pattern of parental influence. Educational and labor market factors explain these differences in mobility: parental resources influence college selectivity, field of study, and earnings more strongly for advanced-degree holders than for those with a bachelor's degree alone.},

  abstract = {What Jonsson (1993) has labelled the `Increased Merit Selection' (IMS) hypothesis suggests that access to education becomes increasingly determined by class origin and that class destination is increasingly dependent on educational achievement, as the influence of characteristics associated with family background become irrelevant. It is on this latter relationship that we shall focus in this contribution. The liberal theory of industrialism held that economically advanced societies would exhibit a high level of social mobility because the increasing number of professional and managerial positions would be filled on the basis of meritocratic principles. `Achieved' characteristics' would displace `ascribed' characteristics as determinants of social position and objective universalistic criteria would displace particularistic standards. (Blau and Duncan, 1967, Parsons, 1954, Treiman, 1970). In such circumstances what is to count as merit? Two main answers have been proposed. The first, which is of direct interest to us, suggests that merit should be equated with educational qualifications. The second definition, which must be addressed if are to be in a position to interpret the evidence relating to the changing impact of education, views merit as constituted by the combined impact of IQ and effort. While, as Jackson (2002) notes, there has been a tendency to treat these two definitions as functionally equivalent, with education providing a proxy measure of IQ and effort, this view has been increasingly challenged,},

  abstract = {We examine the extent to which Americans and Chinese perceive their countries as meritocracies. Chinese and Americans share a strong belief in the importance of education, ambition, and hard work for getting ahead. The Chinese, however, also believe strongly in nonmeritocratic elements, especially social ties. They are thus much more likely than Americans to have a dual-consciousness about getting ahead. Perceptions also vary within each country. In the United States, minorities perceive less meritocracy than whites and men perceive less meritocracy than women. These factors, however, do not explain variations in Chinese perceptions, which are more closely tied to China-specific predictors (e.g., hukou status). We also find that Chinese perceptions reflect the degree of contact with nonrelatives and people in occupations more prestigious than one's own. Together, these findings suggest that American beliefs about the role of merit in social mobility are not unique. They also highlight a need for studies of stratification beliefs in nondemocratic, non-Western countries and research that examines how life experiences influence stratification beliefs.},
